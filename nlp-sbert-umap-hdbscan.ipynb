If you're used to the basic workflow of getting embeddings and projecting them to two dimensions, this notebook contains some unique jumping off points:\n","\n","1. It uses the `paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v1` model from the `sentence-transformers` library instead of Universal Sentence Encoder. I find this gives much better results.\n","2. It uses a custom distance metric, TS-SS, from the paper: [A. Heidarian and M. J. Dinneen, \"A Hybrid Geometric Approach for Measuring Similarity Level Among Documents and Document Clustering,\"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7474366?reload=true). I used [this implementation](https://github.com/taki0112/Vector_Similarity/blob/master/README.md) as a reference, but corrected an error and turned it into a numba function for faster computation.\n","3. In projecting using UMAP, it projects to onto spherical coordinates instead of a traditional Euclidean 2D plane. I personally believe this leads to a much more intuitive understanding of embeddings. Rather than an interpretation on a 2D plane where in some sense we are \"bound\" by the limits of the x-axis and y-axis, it makes more sense to me that the embedding space is \"wrapped\" and doesn't have an end.\n","  1. We are also able to use this spherical projection with haversine distance to develop clusters derived from the spherical projection rather than the planar projection."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import altair as alt\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import plotly.express as
